This tool provides a dense library of colormaps for the purpose of intensity graph and chart integration (or wherever else makes sense for you) in LabVIEW

LabVIEW has no built-in variety for colormaps, and only references a few in some select examples. By using this, you unlock the vast array of options out in the marketplace today on your LabVIEW applications

Utility VIM has a very long default enumeration of possible values, but by design can take in your custom reduced enumeration or just a string

The colormaps were taken directly from matplotlib 3.10.3 and the code that extracted them is available in this repo. (requires python and matplotlib to be installed to run)
